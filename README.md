# Protogen

The proto_gen_compiler (Protogen, for short) is a pure-Python implementation of a protocol generator. Long story short, you write a `.protogen` file and then code is magically generated for you to use! View [docs/README](docs/README.md) for more information.

## Installation

Currently, the best way to install Protogen is by cloning the repository and installing via pip.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/connermarzen/protogen.git
$ python3 -m pip install .
```

> **Note:** I will be working on adding Protogen to Pip very soon. However before I do, I will be adding more documentation.

## Work-in-progress

* Documentation (WIP)
* PyPi package creation (WIP)
* Formal test procedures (Not yet WIP but soon)
